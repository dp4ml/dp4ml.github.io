We invite researchers working on duality (both theory or applications)
to submit their latest work to our ICML 2023 workshop. Accepted papers
will be presented as posters during our poster sessions, and selected
papers will be given an oral presentation.

### Topics
We invite submissions related (but not limited to) the following topics:

**Theory of duality principle:**
* Representer theorems
* Lagrange and Fenchel dualities, generalized conjugacy and abstract convexity
* Convex relaxations and duality for nonconvex problems
* Duality for optimization over measures, duality in optimal transport
* Other dualities in mathematics, e.g., information geometry, algebraic geometry

**Practical applications of duality principle:**
* Fast knowledge adaptation and transfer, lifelong learning, few shot learning etc.
* Model understanding, explanation and interpretation
* Differentiable programming, smoothing discontinuous/discrete maps
* Reinforcement learning, control, and deep learning in general

### Important Dates
