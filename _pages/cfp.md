We invite researchers working on duality (both theory or applications)
to submit their latest work to our ICML 2023 workshop. Accepted papers
will be presented as posters during our poster sessions, and selected
papers will be given an oral presentation.

### Topics
We invite submissions of papers related (but not limited) to the following topics:

**Theory of duality principle:**
* Representer theorems
* Lagrange and Fenchel dualities, generalized conjugacy and abstract convexity
* Duality on manifolds or metric spaces, geodesic convexity
* Convex relaxations and duality for nonconvex problems
* Duality for optimization over measures, duality in optimal transport
* Other dualities in mathematics, e.g., information geometry, algebraic geometry

**Practical applications of duality principle:**
* Fast knowledge adaptation and transfer, lifelong learning, few shot learning etc.
* Model understanding, explanation and interpretation
* Differentiable programming, smoothing discontinuous/discrete maps
* Reinforcement learning, control, and deep learning in general

### Important Dates
* Submission Deadline: May 22nd, 2023 (Anywhere on Earth)
* Acceptance Notification: June 19th, 2023
* Camera-Ready Deadline: *tba*

### Submission Instructions
Submitted papers are composed of a main body, which can be up to
**eight pages** long, followed by unlimited pages for references and
an appendix, all in a single file. For details concerning the format
of the papers, please see the [LaTeX style files](). All submissions must be via
OpenReview and anonymized, otherwise, they will automatically be
rejected. In particular, any submission whose main body goes over the
8 page limit will be automatically rejected.
For the final version, an extra page will be allowed.

[OpenReview submission website](.).
