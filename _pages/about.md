The ICML Duality Principles workshop brings together researchers working on
various duality concepts from many different fields to discuss new
applications for modern machine learning, especially focusing on
topics such as model understanding, explanation, and adaptation in
deep learning and reinforcement learning.

Please see our [Call for Papers](./cfp) for more details!


## What is Duality?
Duality is a pervasive and important principle in mathematics. Not
only has it fascinated researchers in many different fields but it has
also been used extensively in optimization, statistics, and
machine-learning, giving rise to powerful tools such as Fenchel
duality in convex optimization, representer theorems in kernel methods
and Bayesian nonparametrics and dually-flat spaces in information
geometry.

Such applications have played an important role in the past,
but lately we do not see much work on duality principles, especially
in deep learning. For example, Lagrange duality can be useful for
model explanation because it allows us to measure sensitivity of
certain perturbations, but this is not yet fully exploited. This
slowdown is perhaps due to a growing focus on nonconvex and nonlinear
problems where duality does not seem to be directly applicable. With this
workshop, we aim to revive the interest of the ML community in duality
principles.
